I. General Strategy Hints
****************************************************************

CHOICE SCREEN

At the beginning of every period you can always choose any
available character, even though the game defaults to the character
you had played in the previous period.  Listen to what the
characters say when you click the heads - they will not only help
you decide which character to choose, but also help you figure
out what needs to be done during that period.


CONVERSATIONS

When speaking to characters in the game, it is not necessary to ask
every question available.  In fact, in some cases asking the wrong
question can get you in trouble.  For example, if you tell too many
adults about the alien you can be sent to boarding school for
spreading rumors.  Hit ESC or right click whenever you want to end a
conversation, and the remaining dialogue options will disappear.


CLASS SCHEDULE

Your class schedule, which is available on the icon bar, can be useful
to you in many ways:

1) You can check what your assigned class is so you can avoid getting
	a cut.
2) You can see how many tardies, absences, and detentions you have so
	you can avoid getting too many.
3) You can cross-reference with the teachers' schedule in the office to
	help you decide which room to go to.
4) You can see how far into the week you are and therefore how close to
	finishing the game.


ALIEN DEVICE

The alien device, which is available on the icon bar, is a very important
tool, and using it throughout the game can greatly improve gameplay.  The
device is separated into three sections which can each be activated by the
following buttons.

Messages (Top Button)
The icon will blink whenever you receive a new message.  Listening to these
messages help explain various plot points of the game.  In order to hear
them in English, you must have the universal translator in your inventory.
The translator is found in the first room on the spaceship.  Once you have
it, you do not need to select in from your backpack - it will just work.

Maps (Bottom Left Button)
By clicking the arrows you can view maps of each of the levels of the
spaceship.  If you are on the spaceship a red light will blink at your
location.  Also a body icon will blink wherever a kidnapped kid is located
on the spaceship.  The colored circles on the map represent the colors of
the turbolifts that get you to that level (see SPACESHIP NAVIGATION below).

Portal (Bottom Right Button)
The map which appears resembles the map of the school on the Choice Screen.
A blinking red light appears in the room where the portal is presently
located.  The portal allows you to transport to the alien spaceship.  Clicking
the portal button will open the portal no matter where you are and it will
stay open for one minute.  Ideally, you would open the portal when you are in
view of the portal anchor on the wall.


ALIEN HUNTER WEB PAGE

This in-game web site is where you find out about all the tests to prove
which teacher is an alien.  New tests appear in the Tests section throughout
the game so visit the web more than once to discover all the tests.  Once
you read about a test, you must go to the Chat area and ask the webmaster
what items you need to perform the test.


DUCTWORK NAVIGATION

A map of the ductwork is located on the Maintenance Room wall in a box
attached to the duct switch.  When the duct switch is in the up position, you
have access to the majority of the ductwork except for the areas over the
locker rooms and the library.  When the duct switch is in the down position,
you have access to the locker rooms.

You can enter the ducts in a variety of ways.  You must first enter via the
Maintenance Room when the janitor is not there.  If you exit into another
room like a locker room or the kitchen, you can always re-enter from there
through the rest of the game, provided that room is empty.


SPACESHIP NAVIGATION

Although the spaceship corridors all look the same, the locations never
move.  See ALIEN DEVICE for information on maps of the spaceship.  Doors on
the right lead to rooms and doors on the left lead to either turbolifts or
garbage rooms.  The areas of the spaceship include the main level and three
other levels accessible via turbolifts.  The three different turbolifts are
each surrounded by uniquely colored columns.  The blue turbolift cannot be
used until the end of the game when the control room level is accessible.

If you enter a room filled with androids you can escape before they get you.
You have about three seconds to click the edge of the screen to turn around
and then click the door to leave.

II. Tips for Action Sequences
****************************************************************

Action Sequences are all easiest as Duncan and hardest as Peter.  If you
haven't tried them as Duncan yet, you may want to before reading
ahead.  You can also practice these sequences in the Practice Room once
you've played them in the game.  (Except for FALSE ALARM and ANDROID
GAUNTLET which are Duncan sequences only.)

FALSE ALARM

The object is to hit the alarm box four times to set off the alarm before
getting three checkmarks from Ms. Marsh.  Try to keep your cursor over the
alarm box and shoot whenever you get a clear view.  You can shoot down the
airplane, but you do not have to in order to win.


STINK BOMBS

It helps to try to move back to the center position after avoiding a stink
bomb.  Try to notice whose turn it is to throw.  The earlier you can pick
who is throwing, the faster you can move out of the way.  The bombs are
almost never thrown across each other.


DUCT RATS

Don't shoot too much since this sequence is based on how much noise you
make.  Be patient and wait until the rats are close - some rats are just
decoys.  Aiming a little high also makes it easier.


FAN GRATE

Don't shoot too much since this sequence is based on how much noise you
make.  When you hit the switch to stop the fan, try to line up over the
bolts as fast as you can before shooting.

EXTEND BRIDGE

The object is to line up the symbols of the same color.  All three wheels
are revolving at the same speed, so once you figure out the timing for
one wheel, match that timing for the other two.


STUN PODS

The stun pods slow down as they change directions, so this is the best time
to shoot.  The pods have to zap a kid three times before he/she is
abducted, so don't panic if there is more than one pod at a time - you don't
have to shoot them all.


SLIME CREATURE

You must shoot the green light pads four times each in order to drain the
Slime Creature.  You can win as Duncan without ever shooting the Creature
itself, but as Susan or Peter you need to protect yourself by shooting at
the creature's "arms" when it attacks.  Try aiming for the bottom of the
"arm."


ANDROID GAUNTLET

You must shoot each android or stun pod twice in order to blow it up so
stay on them.  When you get to the engines, you must shoot them so the
engine meter goes down before yours does.  If you have enough energy when
you reach the engines, don't worry about being hit by the androids, just
blast away at the engines.

III. Answers to Puzzles
****************************************************************

Puzzles are all easiest as Peter and hardest as Duncan.  If you
haven't tried as Peter yet in the game, you may want to before reading
ahead.  Especially the WAHOO SEARCH where Peter has the least words to
choose from.

IV. Cool Stuff You May Have Missed
****************************************************************

ALIEN REVEALS

Once you know the alien's identity, if you spy on his/her room from the
ducts when he/she is alone you will witness the alien pulling its mask off.


ABDUCTIONS

If you enter the boys' locker room after a boy is called to the gym, or the
girls' locker room after a girl is called you will witness an abduction.
If you had found the ray gun and alien lenses aboard the spaceship you will
be able to attempt to save the kid.


TEACHER'S LOUNGE

If you win the FAN GRATE, you will gain access to the teachers' lounge from
the ductwork.  However, you will only be able to enter the lounge once you
know the identity of the alien.  Once inside you will be able to find the
alien's kidnap list and find out who is next to be abducted.


ALIEN HUNTER WEB PAGE

In addition to finding out the tests to use, there is also a lot of fun
stuff on the in-game web site which is updated the first five times you
visit.  If you had only been to the web once or twice, go back and take
a look at all the sightings and artifacts.


REASONS FOR REPLAYING ONCE YOU'VE WON

1) Each lead character has a unique win ending.  Try all three.

2) The alien can be any of the three teachers.  Try a new game and see
 	who it is this time.

3) There are five different tests you can perform.  Try out each one and
	see what happens.

4) Each lead character has unique questions throughout the game.  Try
	choosing different characters at different periods.

5) If you enjoyed any of the action sequences, you can play them all you
	want in the Practice Room.
